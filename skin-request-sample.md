## To help making a skin request

### If you wanna make it faster to add your skin request, please help us providing at least 5 screenshots with:

map-selection: 

mod-selection: 

pause: 

you-failed: 

results: 

### Select a map (or [this one](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/4690352)) that has at least 1 play on the leaderboard, so it can be seen on the screenshots.


### To make it even faster for us to accept your request, please rename the screenshot files to those in the list and make sure the background from the current selected beatmap is bright enough, take a look at the current uploaded skins for reference, i would recommend even using the [same map](https://osu.ppy.sh/beatmaps/4690352) for that.

Thats all, thanks for the help <3
